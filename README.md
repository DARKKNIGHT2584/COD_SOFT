# CODSOFT
Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Showcase! This repository features the projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project demonstrates my abilities in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, reflecting the knowledge and experience I gained throughout my internship.

Below is a summary of the projects:

**Task 1: Movie Genre Classification**  
**Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Employed techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings in conjunction with classifiers like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

**Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
**Description:** Constructed a model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilized a dataset containing information about credit card transactions and experimented with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

**Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction**  
**Description:** Created a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Leveraged historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and applied algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to forecast churn. 

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity provided by Codsoft. This experience has been instrumental in enhancing my skills, and I look forward to applying what I have learned to further my expertise in machine learning and data science."# CODSOFT"
